Highlevel TODO

RIGHTNOW

endturn stuff!
stomp!
copy!


STUFF

 [ ] Add floater generator
     * needed only for a few games
 [ ] Add offset generator
     * simple slight hack to neighbour
     * we're already adding offsets to boardconnections
 [d] Add foridin and forposin to effect
 [d] Delete `dead` groups? simplifies a lot!
     * use a var if u must count or whatever!
     * when kill, delete the unit entirely
     * easier to copy units and default unit groups!
     * speaking of, make unitgroups only use those that are actually used in battle! yeah?
     * need spawn to use NEXTID
     * maybe make an object:
     	kings: [units,kings],
     	queens: [units,]
 [d] Calculate initial terrain 
 [ ] Implement forced moves if opp/you only has 1 option!
 [ ] Implement CALC "layers", for example for Archimedes
 [ ] Also need multilayers, for example for Archers
 [ ] Add highlight. it really would be nice, especially for formation win conditions

FLOW
 [d] Instruction type. Universals + if
 [ ] add link to instruction
     * special for endturn, put logic right into the linking!
 [ ] Make a draw func for state. Is also plr specific, can output really nice obj!
 [ ] Markeffect function
     * just adds the mark from a presumed global (which will be a func arg)
 [Â ] apply generators func
     * adds single or whole list of runGenerators. obs, needs if and ifelse and playercase!

     ****** SCOPE *******

`player` and `otherplayer` is not in the passed-in scope, since the engine is player-specific.
should also add support for PLAYERVAR and BATTLEVAR

always there
     connections  (permanent)
     BOARD        (permanent)
     TERRAIN      (playerspecific (maybe))
     player
     otherplayer
     ownernames   (playerspecific) ["neutral", "opp", "my"]

state
     LAYERS       (recalculated, sometimes preserved)
     UNITDATA     (mutating)
     UNITLAYERS   (recalculated)
     CONTEXT      (mutating through turn)
     nextunitid
     links        (overwritten after every single event)


     ****** FLOW *******

Any runGenerator(s) inside `.endgame` will be run if we attempt to `link` to endturn.
Effects, however, will only be applied on a successful endturn.
