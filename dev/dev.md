Highlevel TODO

RIGHTNOW

endturn stuff!
stomp!
copy!


STUFF

 [ ] Add floater generator
     * needed only for a few games
 [ ] Add offset generator
     * simple slight hack to neighbour
     * we're already adding offsets to boardconnections
 [d] Add foridin and forposin to effect
 [d] Delete `dead` groups? simplifies a lot!
     * use a var if u must count or whatever!
     * when kill, delete the unit entirely
     * easier to copy units and default unit groups!
     * speaking of, make unitgroups only use those that are actually used in battle! yeah?
     * need spawn to use NEXTID
     * maybe make an object:
     	kings: [units,kings],
     	queens: [units,]
 [d] Calculate initial terrain 
 [ ] Implement forced moves if opp/you only has 1 option!
 [ ] Implement CALC "layers", for example for Archimedes
 [ ] Also need multilayers, for example for Archers
 [ ] Add highlight. it really would be nice, especially for formation win conditions
 [d] Add ifover and unlessover to draw condition

FLOW
 [d] Instruction type. Universals + if
 [ ] add link to instruction
     * special for endturn, put logic right into the linking!
 [ ] Make a draw func for state. Is also plr specific, can output really nice obj!
 [ ] Markeffect function
     * just adds the mark from a presumed global (which will be a func arg)
 [Â ] apply generators func
     * adds single or whole list of runGenerators. obs, needs if and ifelse and playercase!

     ****** SCOPE *******

`player` and `otherplayer` is not in the passed-in scope, since the engine is player-specific.
should also add support for PLAYERVAR and BATTLEVAR

always there
     connections  (permanent)
     BOARD        (permanent)
     TERRAIN      (playerspecific (maybe))
     ownernames   (playerspecific) ["neutral", "opp", "my"]
     player
     ishuman
     playername
     otherplayer
     othername
     otherhuman

step
     LAYERS       (recalculated, sometimes preserved)
     UNITDATA     (mutating)
     UNITLAYERS   (recalculated)
     CONTEXT      (mutating through turn)
     nextunitid
     potentiallinks (overwritten after every single event)
     links        (overwritten after every single event)
     path         (replaced using concat)
     stepid

turn
     canend       (array of stepid:s, built)
     steps        (step states by stepid)
     blockedby    (string)
battle
     battleendstep (id of step when this battle ended)
     winner       (player who won if battle has ended)

     ****** FLOW *******

Any runGenerator(s) inside `.endgame` will be run if we attempt to `link` to endturn.
Effects, however, will only be applied on a successful endturn.


Links object! keys are positions (marks) or commands, values are the function to call

potentiallinks = {
     a1: 'selectunit', // replace with id? separate calculated?
     win: 'endTurn',
     move: 'move'
}
links = {
     a1: 'root-b2-a1',
     win: 'root-b2-win',
     move: 'root-b2-move'
}


Functions will always be called with state object and key
