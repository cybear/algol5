{GAME} was invented by Robert A. Krauss in the early 70:s, and published in an issue of the Games & Puzzles magazine.

It is a simple (and solved) game, but even so, the easy rules and tug-of-war over the common neutral unit makes for interesting play.

{ME} also implements the {GAME:id=paperneutron} variant by {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=Walter Joris}, but for technical reasons that is a separate game entry and not a variant here.
