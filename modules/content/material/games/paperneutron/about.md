{GAME} by {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=Walter Joris} was published in Joris' brilliant book {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=100 Strategic Game for Pen and Paper}.

It is a variant of {GAME:id=neutron} by Robert A. Krauss, but for various reasons we have chosen to have {GAME} as a separate entry.

Unlike most games in the book where you continuously add to the board, {GAME} functions more like a regular game where pieces actually move - this is accomplished by simply redrawing the board after each move is made.

However - as a concession to this process - Joris made the board smaller and added a second neutron, which makes for a very quick and vicious game!
