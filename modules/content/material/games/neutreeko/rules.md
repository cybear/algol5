{GAME} is played on one of the following boards and setups:

<div class="md-3col">
{SETUP:board=basic,name=basic}
{SETUP:board=small,name=small}
{SETUP:board=mini,name=mini}
</div>

Regular {GAME} to the left, small variant in the middle and mini variant to the right.

Players take turn to {CMND:name=move} one of their {UNIT:group=pieces} orthodiagonally, as far as it can in that direction without leaving the board or entering/jumping over an occupied cell.

Win by arranging your {UNIT:group=pieces} into a line! Diagonals included.
