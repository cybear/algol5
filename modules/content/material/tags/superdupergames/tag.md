{EXTLINK:url=http://superdupergames.org/,text=Super Duper Games} offers online play of over 100 games with very solid implementations.

It claims to still be in beta, but both game implementations and online play is very solid. A highly recommended site, and one that {ME} aspires to resemble more as it grows up!
